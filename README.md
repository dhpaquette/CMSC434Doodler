# CMSC434Doodler

What is it?
-----------

The CMSC434Doodler is a drawing/doodle application that allows the user to draw various paths through touch on the canvas.
The user can select from 5 colors: Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, and Magenta. They can also select brush size, undo each path that is drawn,
redo to reverse the undo process, and clear the canvas entirely.

Installation
------------
One can issue a pull request to grab the entire repo. The repository is simply the folder as it would exist in the 
AndroidStudioProjects folder. So it could be opened like a project normally would on a computer with Android Studio. 
At that point, running it is as easy as pressing the run button and having gradle build it.
